# RLFactor — XRPL Invoice NFT Auction Platform — Operating on Testnet
**Tokenizing future invoices into tradable on-chain assets**

---

## TL;DR
This MVP demonstrates how the **XRP Ledger (XRPL)** can be used to tokenize, auction, and settle future invoice payments using **native XRPL features** — including NFTs (NFToken), issued tokens (RLUSD-style mock), trustlines and wallet-based authentication.

Businesses convert unpaid invoices into immediate liquidity, while investors acquire future payment rights at a discount — with ownership and settlement transparently handled on-chain.

---

## The Problem
Small and medium businesses often wait **30–90 days** to receive payment after issuing invoices even though they've already delivered goods/services. 

During this period:
- Cash flow is constrained
- Financing options are centralized and opaque  
- Settlement lacks transparency  

---

## The Idea
A **future payment (invoice / receivable)** is represented as an **NFT on XRPL**.

The NFT represents:
- The right to receive a **fixed payment amount**
- From a **specific payer**
- At a **future maturity date**

This NFT can be auctioned on a marketplace, allowing:
- Sellers to receive liquidity immediately  
- Investors to acquire future payment rights  
- Settlement to be enforced economically on-chain once funded  

This follows the **invoice factoring** economic model, implemented using XRPL primitives.

---

## High-Level Flow

1. An establishment mints an **Invoice NFT** on the XRP Ledger representing a real-world accounts receivable with a fixed amount and maturity date.
2. The Invoice NFT is listed on an **on-chain auction marketplace** with a defined bidding period.
3. Investors place bids using an **issued stable token (RLUSD-style, testnet/mock)**, with bids secured via XRPL escrows.
4. At auction close, **delivery-versus-payment (DVP)** is executed: the highest bidder receives the NFT and the seller receives payment.
5. Upon NFT maturity, the **current NFT holder is entitled to receive the underlying payment** from the originating establishment, completing the settlement of the tokenized real-world asset.

## XRPL Features Used
This project is intentionally built using **XRPL native primitives**, without general-purpose smart contracts.
## **Features & XRPL Usage**

Below is a breakdown of RLFactor’s core features and the specific XRPL primitives used to implement each one.

---

### 🧾 **Invoice Real World Asset Tokenization (NFTs)**

- **What it does:**  
  Converts real-world invoices into unique on-chain assets (NFTs) that represent the right to receive future payment.

- **XRPL primitives used:**  
  - `NFTokenMint` (XLS-20 NFTs)

- **How we use it:**  
  Each invoice is minted as an XRPL NFT. The NFT’s URI links to metadata containing the invoice number, face value, maturity date, mintTxHash, issuer, offer index and image. Ownership of the NFT determines who is entitled to payment when the maturity date is reached.

- **Viewing Created NFTs on Dashboard**

- **Created NFTs can also be found on Testnet**

---

### 🏷️ **Auction-Based Invoice Marketplace**

- **What it does:**  
  Allows invoice NFTs to be listed and auctioned so businesses can access liquidity earlier.

- **XRPL primitives used:**  
  - `NFTokenCreateOffer`  
  - `NFTokenAcceptOffer`

- **How we use it:**
  When an auction starts, the invoice NFT is placed into an on-ledger auction state by creating a sell offer, preventing arbitrary transfers during the bidding period.

  When the auction ends, the winning bid is accepted and ownership of the invoice NFT is transferred on-ledger to the winning bidder. The XRP Ledger records each ownership change, ensuring transparent and auditable provenance.

> Note: For MVP simplicity, the platform temporarily holds NFTs during auctions. This can be replaced with a fully non-custodial flow using XRPL offers in future iterations.

- **Example of NFTs listed on Auction**

---

### 💰 **Issued Token Payments (RLUSD-style)**

- **What it does:**  
  Enables stable-value bidding and settlement for invoice purchases.

- **XRPL primitives used:**  
  - Issued tokens  
  - `TrustSet` (trustlines)  
  - `Payment` transactions (issued currency)

- **How we use it:**  
  Investors bid using an issued stable-value token (RLUSD). Trustlines ensure only approved wallets can hold and transact the token. Payments are settled directly on XRPL.

- **Example of Bid Placement**

---

### 🔐 **Non-Custodial Wallet Authentication**

- **What it does:**  
  Allows users to authenticate and transact without sharing private keys.

- **XRPL primitives used:**  
  - Wallet signature verification (off-ledger cryptographic signing)

- **How we use it:**  
  Users authenticate by signing a challenge with their XRPL wallet to log in. The platform verifies the signature and never stores private keys.

---

### 🔄 **On-Chain Ownership & Payment Entitlement**

- **What it does:**  
  Ensures the current NFT holder is always the party entitled to receive payment at maturity.

- **XRPL primitives used:**  
  - NFT ownership records  
  - Issued token payments

- **How we use it:**  
  At invoice maturity, the debtor sends payment directly in RLUSD to the wallet holding the invoice NFT. Maturity settlement is executed via XRPL NFT sell offers, enabling an atomic exchange of the invoice NFT for RLUSD between the NFT holder and the originating establishment. No additional contracts or intermediaries are required.

- **Example of outstanding Receivables(tied to owned NFTs) for an Investor Account**

## Architecture Overview

### On-Chain (XRPL = Source of Truth)
- NFT existence and ownership  
- Issued token balances  
- Transaction history  

### Off-Chain (Application & Backend)
- Auction timing and expiry  
- Marketplace listings  
- Wallet authentication  
- Role-based dashboards  
- Coordination of XRPL transactions

**Private keys are never stored or transmitted.**

---

## Wallet Authentication Flow
1. Client requests a unique challenge  
2. Client signs it using an XRPL wallet (client-side)  
3. Server verifies signature  
4. Server issues short-lived JWT  

No passwords. No custody. No personal data.
